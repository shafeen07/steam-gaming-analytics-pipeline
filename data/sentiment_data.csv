730,Counter-Strike 2,"I started playing Counter-Strike in version 1.3 and moved to 1.5 before switching to 1.6 for competitive matches. I avoided playing Source and CS:GO because their slow gameplay speed deviated from the traditional fast Counter-Strike gameplay I loved.

The new matchmaking system in Counter-Strike 2 interests me, but the gameplay experience differs substantially from what I expected. The game visuals and textures appear too refined which creates a plasticine effect that disrupts the game's visual appearance. It is an acquired visual, and not sure I enjoy the one presented here even after adapting to it.

The weapons sound design is quite poor. It's quite muffled, while the visual distinction between players and their surroundings creates difficulties when trying to detect enemies. The footstep audio is also quite reduced to the original setting, making it harder to detect opponents who are nearby. The grenades are tiny, barely visible.

The essential gameplay elements which made the classic Counter-Strike versions 1.5 and 1.6 unique have undergone significant changes, and it is very apparent. My 25 years of experience with the series made it difficult to adjust to CS2 because I needed to relearn basic gameplay mechanics which surprised me as a seasoned player. Yeah, my headshot ratio is still high, however the movement, and generally the speed, element of surprise is completely gone. It takes forever to rush a single bomb site. The models feel heavy, sluggish, even with a knife. The jumping mechanism is slower than usual.

One thing that made Counter-Strike 1.5 and 1.6 great, was the movement. You could easily navigate, with a bit of practice. In CS2 it feels like an uphill battle for no reason.

The CS2 does retain some of the Counter-Strike flair, yet it presents a completely different gameplay experience than the original versions. The main problem in ranked matches of CS2 stems from the high number of cheaters who play against legitimate players. The high number of fake and purchased accounts creates a noticeable problem which ruins the gameplay experience. These are not small number of players, this is notably every 2nd account that is in any ranked matchmaking. They either use Wallhack, or Aimbot, or a combination of the two. It's very typical. 

Although CS 1.5 and 1.6 have their own Cheater issues, these are mostly easily recognized, and people who cheat tend to get punished quickly by server ban.

I have not fully investigated Faceit but I believe cheating might still exist within this platform, unsure. The current VAC anti-cheat system fails to provide sufficient protection against cheating activities, and I've experienced this in 4/5 games I've played this week alone. It's amazing how many cheaters there are! 

I do think that the game requires dedicated servers with active administrators to manage gameplay and create a balanced competitive environment. The game shows promise but it deviates from the traditional Counter-Strike gameplay that true fans of the game know and love.",0,neutral,0.5500109195709229,0,2025-09-02 21:13:10+00,2025-09-18 15:32:42.097339+00

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I recently created this Steam account just to play CS2 with some friends. They told me I needed to reach level 10 first, and I thought, ""Alright, that shouldn‚Äôt be too hard.""

Unfortunately, Valve makes this process extremely frustrating. I'm constantly being matched either with obvious cheaters or players who have been around since 2015/2016 and have way more experience than me. The cheaters are often blatant, yet nothing happens to them ‚Äî VAC seems to completely ignore it.

If you want to play with friends, your only real option is to use an older account. But if you don‚Äôt have one yourself, you'd have to buy one or get it from someone else ‚Äî which is clearly against the Terms of Service and can lead to a ban.

So you're left with two bad choices: play in unfair matches full of cheaters, or risk a hardware ban by trying to bypass the system. At this point, I honestly understand why some players are willing to take that risk.

The way new CS2 players are treated is extremely disappointing. It feels like Valve is completely ignoring how broken the early experience is.

The connectivity issues make Counter-Strike, Completely unjustifiable. with basic logic you would expect a competitive title to ensure the best servers, a high standard. but it seems its the opposite.

730,Counter-Strike 2," Absolute Perfection ‚Äì CS2 is More Than a Game, It‚Äôs My Life

Counter-Strike 2 isn‚Äôt just an upgrade ‚Äî it‚Äôs a revolution. From the moment I launched it, I knew this was something special. The visuals? Crisp, immersive, next-level. The smoke grenades that now dynamically flow with the air? The reimagined maps with stunning detail? The lightning-fast netcode that makes every flick shot feel just right? Valve didn‚Äôt just update a game ‚Äî they rebirthed a legacy.

I‚Äôve poured hundreds of hours into CS over the years, and CS2 feels like the game I‚Äôve always dreamed of. Whether I‚Äôm clutching out a 1v5 on Mirage, dropping a perfect flash on Dust II, or coordinating with my team in competitive, every match is pure adrenaline. The sound design is so precise I can tell an AWP shot from a scout just by the echo. The balance? Flawless. The community? Still the most intense, passionate group of players in gaming.

I play almost every day ‚Äî with friends, in ranked, in deathmatch just to warm up. CS2 has brought me closer to my squad, challenged my mind, sharpened my reflexes, and given me memories I‚Äôll never forget. That ace with the M4? The knife flick that shut down the round? Pure magic.

Thank you, Valve, for not just preserving what made Counter-Strike legendary, but for evolving it with such care and precision. This isn‚Äôt just my favorite shooter ‚Äî it‚Äôs my obsession. CS2 isn‚Äôt just worth every penny‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs priceless.

730,Counter-Strike 2,"Counter-Strike 2 isn‚Äôt perfect, but let‚Äôs be honest: neither was CS:GO, and we still sank thousands of hours into it. CS2 takes the foundation we already love ‚Äî the tension of a 1v3 clutch, the deafening sound of a perfectly timed flash, the dopamine hit of an eco round win ‚Äî and brings it into a new era.

What works:

- Gunplay feels crisp. Tapping heads with the AK never gets old, and spraying still takes actual skill instead of RNG praying.

- Smokes are next-level. Dynamic, volumetric, reactive. Shooting or throwing nades through them is a game-changer. Feels like CS, but evolved.

- Source 2 glow-up. Maps are brighter, cleaner, and easier to read. Even classic Mirage feels like a fresh experience.

- Matchmaking is faster. I‚Äôm queuing with friends in minutes instead of waiting in limbo.

- Same heart-pounding clutch moments. When it‚Äôs down to you, the bomb, and 3 enemies hunting you ‚Äî nothing else in gaming compares.

What doesn‚Äôt (yet):

- Performance can dip on mid-tier rigs. Source 2 looks gorgeous, but it eats weaker PCs for breakfast.

- Some sound bugs and netcode quirks still pop up ‚Äî classic CS experience, honestly.

- The community‚Ä¶ is still the community. But that‚Äôs part of the charm, right?

At its core, CS2 is still Counter-Strike: brutal, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. It‚Äôs a free upgrade, it already feels like home, and despite the rough edges, it‚Äôs the best version of CS we‚Äôve had in years.

I miss when shooters were fun, now it just feels like every third world country lunatic was put in a room with pillows and pretends to be a heavy weight UFC champion with their secret weapon being to throw their own feces at one another.

And they call that a game.

I'm too tired to pier review my own review I guess.

Don't play this game, I feel like the majority of people who play this game are similar to Andrew Tate consumers.
It just sucks man there's no fun.

Face it is no better, I tried a couple games and it was awful. At least in low ELO no one talks, and the ones that do just don't want to hear anything from you because they're just stuck in their own heads.

When you do try to start a conversation or give clear comms they blame you for doing something wrong, or if you make a mistake they call you trash for the rest of the game.
""Retard"" this ""Nigger"" that and so on and so forth.

I grew up learning that gaming was a safe haven for shut ins like me and stuff.
This is probably the opposite. Everyone just thinks they're hot shit and they talk about rape and violence and doing drugs and shit.
If it's not that then it's probably just half assed depressed 50 year old dads trying to relive what used to be probably a good game.

anyway good night, don't play the game not worth the time

play minecraft by yourself and try to learn how to build things or maybe go learn law so you can get a cut of that Roblox shit whenever that Bazuki idiot CEO or whatever offs himself
He was probably on the island.

730,Counter-Strike 2,"Bad netcode, no tutorial for newcomers, it's as if this game was meant only for those who played this from the getgo starting from CS 1.6, so if you are new, getting into the thick of it is quite challenging. 

Very questionable firing mechanics, namely hip firing being super accurate (LMAO) as long as you stay still or crouch or, better yet, strafe and then immediately stop to get 100% accuracy within several ms is just a bs feature that should be permanently removed from the game especially given how the netcode is so bad and you see the person just running and gunning but he is actually moving-counterstrafing-standing-shooting, which makes you think that the person is just cheating. 

RNG damage on guns, for example it can take 4-5 shots to kill an armored player or 5-6 depending on the gun even if you shoot in exact same spot in the training workshop map, which IMO is stupid given how the in game counterstrafing mechanic makes you super accurate for a few ms, so should the damage be exactly the same (which never happens in real life, but so does the counter strafing - that doens't happen in real life) so the game is extremely inconsistent with its logic implementation. 

Honestly shooting at the range with real guns is far more pleasureable and easier than trying to aim in this POS of a game. I hope this game crashes and burns.

Additionally, there's a ton of cheaters who see through walls, who use aimbot, who's bullets curve around the wall, and it's like that in every other game, sometimes you get more than 1 cheater in a match. And as much as I would like to say it's a bad thing, given how s**t this game is to begin with, I hope there will be even more cheaters in this game, because the only thing that can kill this game is more cheating. 

So more cheaters in the game - the faster this game dies and hopefully people will switch to something better, meanwhile the greedy f**ks at valve will lose their money. 

So my last words/advice in this review - if you consider playing it, install all the cheats and kill this game from within as fast as possible, it's irredemable at this point, at least I will get a good laugh with all the cheaters inside this game.",-0.846981942653656,negative,0.846981942653656,0,2025-08-27 22:46:32+00,2025-09-18 15:34:19.464036+00

No, I'm not being salty, I've been coiunting. I have been solo slooping (bc I don't know anyone who owns the game and open crew rn sucks) for a few weeks now and between today and yesterday, I've been sunk by the same 'random' encounter of a skele-galleon and a megolodon both targeting me. 

This wouldn't be such an issue if Rare's EU servers actually functioned well (and I checked, it's not a client side issue) because let's be real, a skele shiop and a meg aren't that bad. The problem is, each time I've come across this weirdly specific scenario recently, the game doesn't seem to register that I've actually bailed any buckets, despite the fact I'm doing basically nothing but bailing, given that the water seems to be rising at an abnormal rate.

Idk, maybe I'm just bad at the game and I'm just unaware of some new secret mechanic where commpleting a voyage triggers a magolodon-skelly galleon combo. But it really feels like Rare needs to rethink how PvE encounters work. or at the very least FIX THEIR DAMN SERVERS.

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I would not recommend this game to others because it has huge defects. Valve is accepting cheaters to play on the platform. Every game at high level has at least 1 with hidden cheats. Even when its obivious they are not detected, some ive seen with 1-2k hours still not banned.

Yesterday I was playing solo as I usually do, after the game (I was second on scoreboard) the forth guy on the scoreboard asked next? He invited some, I accepted and we played next game. Before starting the other game, the enemy team started calling him a cheater, after looking at cswatch. I looked to and it was sus he had 100 aim and 100 winrate bla bla bla, so he was a blatant cheater. Knowing that I would never have qued with him since im a supporter to Counter strike since at least 2002. 

The enemy team was cheating aswell, so he started being obvious and VAC cancelled the match exactly at the point when we won the game. Since I was in a que with him I got a 20 hour ban, and now it seems like ive lost my elo? I dont know how much but its not visible atm.

Other than that there is someone using aimkey or wallhack every other game basically since im at 25k+ in premier.
Tried faceit and reached 2500 elo solo queing which is decent but not the best. And over there its the same, new accounts that use cheat and goes undetected. The community is basically fkd. Also its an extremely toxic community with racist slurs and just toxic behavior like none other. And valve as usual close their eyes and takes their money for skins and Prime status.

Decided to give it another go recently. I'm certainly glad I did. You meet a few, shall we say, 'quirky' players and sometimes just some bloodthirsty crews who'll sink you no matter what. But honestly, I've generally had good luck with crossing paths with relatively decent folk and chill crews who're doing the same as me - enjoying this wondrous gem of a game.

I gotta hand it to Rare: they really nailed this one. The art style is perfect for this game. Not trying to be too realistic nor too cartoony (think Fortnite), but just perfect. The sea and ocean mechanics are the best in any ocean genre I've played to date. The ships are great and jumping in for a bit of adventure is easy - no needless grinding of resources or hoarding of ammo and food. Just load up, pick a voyage, or just set sail and see where the wind takes you.

I love the emergent gameplay. Even a 'routine' merchant voyage can lead to epic adventures beyond imagining that leave me excited to tell the tale after I log out.

They also tend to camp out delivery spots on outposts to kill people turning in their loot. I know it's a pirate game, but it can be kind of frustrating when you're playing solo and can easily be ganged up on, losing hours of progress. Other than that it's fine.

1172620,Sea of Thieves,"I love the concept of the game and for the most part I do actually love the game. This game honestly does have so much potential but speaking as someone who has unlocked the skeleton curse, ghost curse, and shores of gold curse the content updates they do every season are just not enough for the three to seven months (season 9). I mean hear me out this season so far has literally just been reskinned voyages with reskinned assets. A basic accessibility feature, fov, took Rare around 7 years to add since they patch the ini file fov increase. Lets not even talk about the in-game currency and how little new cosmetics they add every season, thank you Rare for adding in 5 new weapon skins I can buy with gold for an entire season. The plunderpass could also be better, like why add in one-off weapon skins that don't match with anything else in the game rather than have a plunderpass that is dedicated to an entire weapon set (same with the clothing). Servers are another big issue, around 4 years ago sot was actually a really good game to play even if you had terrible ping, but the past 2 years or so the servers are just horrendous (or how you HAVE to cap your FPS to 144FPS or lower so you don't rubberband or have any random glitches or delays). Or lets not talk about the game breaking bugs that have been in the game for years and haven't been fixed, or how the bugs they fix magically come back after a random update, or how the devs pick and choose which bugs/exploits get patched or kept in the game. I still love the game and will keep playing until it's eventual EoS, but in its current state I just can't recommend sot as a long time game at all; obviously if you're only playing it for a couple hours to goof off with your friends it's a good game, but for the long haul it's debatable.",0.809198796749115,positive,0.809198796749115,0,2025-09-08 06:05:15+00,2025-09-18 15:40:06.556113+00

730,Counter-Strike 2,"The Good: A Visual and Technical Leap
The most immediate and striking difference in CS2 is its visual fidelity. The Source 2 engine has transformed the game, with stunningly detailed maps, realistic lighting, and physically-based rendering that makes weapon skins and environments pop like never before. Maps like Inferno and Anubis, which received full overhauls, are particularly impressive, showcasing a level of detail that brings them closer to modern AAA titles. Even the ""touchstone"" maps like Dust II, which retain their original layouts, benefit from improved lighting that enhances visibility and character readability.

Beyond the visuals, CS2 introduces several key technical innovations. The new ""sub-tick"" architecture is designed to make player actions like shooting and grenade throws more precise, ensuring what you see is what you get, regardless of the server's tick rate. The dynamic, volumetric smoke grenades are a game-changer. They now fill spaces naturally and can be cleared by shooting or throwing high-explosive grenades, creating new strategic possibilities and counters that were impossible in CS:GO. This change alone has forced a fundamental rethink of how players use utility.

The new Premier mode, with its Elo-based rating system and map-veto phase, is a solid step toward a more professional and rewarding competitive experience. It successfully replicates the feel of a high-stakes match, a feature that was sorely needed in CS:GO's public matchmaking.

The Mixed: A Legacy of Change
While the core gameplay is largely the same, CS2's mechanics have been a point of contention. The movement, shooting, and general ""feel"" of the game have been a frequent topic of debate within the community and among professional players. Some veteran players feel that the game lacks the snappy, responsive feel of CS:GO, citing issues with hit registration, peekers' advantage, and the overall ""weight"" of player movement. This has led to a feeling of inconsistency for those with tens of thousands of hours in the previous game.

The transition also came with a significant loss of features. Many beloved game modes from CS:GO, such as Arms Race, Danger Zone, and Retakes, were absent at launch. While some, like Arms Race, have since been re-added, the initial release felt barebones. Community server support, a cornerstone of the franchise, was also lacking for a long period, which alienated many players who enjoyed custom game modes and maps. The shorter MR12 (max 12 rounds) format for competitive matches is also a divisive change, with some appreciating the faster pace while others miss the strategic depth of the longer MR15 format.

The Bad: Performance and Cheating
CS2's biggest Achilles' heel has been its technical performance. Unlike CS:GO, which could run on a wide range of hardware, CS2 is significantly more demanding. Players, including professionals, have reported frequent performance issues, stuttering, and frame drops, even on high-end systems. This lack of optimization has made the game less accessible and has been a major source of frustration for the player base.

The state of the anti-cheat system is another major concern. User reviews and community discussions are filled with complaints about the prevalence of cheaters, particularly at higher ranks. The community feels that Valve's anti-cheat measures are not up to the task, leading to a frustrating and unfair competitive environment that undermines the integrity of the game. This issue has led many players to abandon official matchmaking in favor of third-party platforms.

Conclusion
Counter-Strike 2 is a game with immense potential and a solid foundation. The move to Source 2 has given the franchise a much-needed visual and technical facelift, and the dynamic smoke grenades are a revolutionary change for the tactical shooter genre. However, its full release was premature. The game launched with a laundry list of missing features and critical technical problems, most notably with performance and anti-cheat. It's a game that feels like it's still in an extended beta, a beautiful shell that's waiting to be fully polished. For new players, it offers an accessible and modern entry into the Counter-Strike world. For veterans, it's a test of patience, a promise of a great game that is slowly but surely being realized.",0.8970550894737244,positive,0.8970550894737244,0,2025-09-07 19:05:06+00,2025-09-18 15:40:37.927694+00

It‚Äôs not perfect. Grinding can get repetitive and you‚Äôll occasionally run into hackers or griefers, but the sheer amount of freedom makes up for it. No two sessions are ever the same and the game still finds ways to surprise me even after all this time.

Any type of glitch or bug that allows you to make money gets immediately patched, while game breaking bugs are ignored, game balance is ignored (for the sake of selling you more vehicles), server performace is pathetic (you regularly get stuck on loading screens and have incredibly slow loading times) and cheaters run rampant. I am not exaggerating when I say that this game has more cheaters than I have ever seen in all other games I've played combined. You literally can't find a lobby without one. And there have been security risks reported for the players too because of this.

1172620,Sea of Thieves,"Its a pretty fun game for sailing out with a bunch of friends (solo is also fine, but I find it gets repetetive and boring far slower if you play with others) and go on little adventures on the seas and a bunch of pretty cool islands together. It includes a set of mechanics that are very easy to learn but hard to master. Everybody has identical gear and almost all progress is pretty much cosmetic after you unlock captained ships, so in theory every crew has a fair shot in PVP and grinding is possible but not at all necessary. That being said, there are a lot of sweats playing the game 24/7 with insane PVP-strategies and skillsets that are absolutely going to obliterate anybody remotely new to the game. Its all about piracy, so your loot is never really your loot until you sold it off and, if youre playing high-seas, you should get ready to get into a bunch of interactions with other players. Some of them are really friendly and helpful, others just want to see the world burn and steal your stuff. For new players, I would definetly advise to play with more experienced friends or first start of in safer seas to get a feel for the game. Being constantly sunk during grinding can be annoying, but the chance of it happening can be massively decreased by gaining some experience first and playing more. If youre just looking for a fun time and dont worry about playing a bunch to get better, I would strongly advise not to play solo or just go to safer seas if you have a low tolerance for frustration by losing progress.

1172620,Sea of Thieves,"UPSIDE: 

This game is overall very nice and worth trying. Graphics are beautiful soundtracks likewise. Gameplay is thrilling with plenty of things to do all the time and it can make you busy for hundreds of hours. Therefore its worth the money.

Consider that you need to be at least team of 2 for this game to be enjoable. More the better. Solo experience is rather hardcore. You can go with random open crew but its very chaotic for most of the time.

75% of community is also very nice. You can meet people and have nice chat, cooperation or fight . Whatever you want.

DOWNSIDE:

Remaining 25% of population. People with thousands of hours and nothing to do I guess? Chasing players around for mostly nothing. Thats where most negative reviews about this game came from I think. If they just hunted you down, sunk your ship and took your stuff, it would be fine I guess since its the pirate game in the end. However they will just spawnkill you on your boat. For unlimited ammount of time if you dont change server. I believe that if someone just started with the game and is lucky enough to encounter this several times during his first day, he is done with the game for good at that point. 

There is a pure PVP mode but being 3v2 or 4v1 etc. and killing guy over and over before he can even load the game after revive is somehow more uplifting and ego boosting for some individuals than real challenge.

1172620,Sea of Thieves,"A game that can fit any playstyle and can create some great laughs but also great despair.

In my opinion the game is fun, I love exploring the seas and doing quests to come back with a big hoard to sell for profit to then use that gold to get myself some fancy new cosmetics. It's especially fun with a friend- up to 3 friends even! No matter if trilling gameplay or roleplaying as a pirate with friends is your cuppa tea- you will likely find your place on the Sea of Thieves.

The game is also actively being updated with rather big updated often with the seasons, also offering an optional battle pass, only locking cosmetics behind it. No weapons are ever locked behind any unlocks, you will always have access to all weapons and tools, just the skins are unlockable.

Though the game doesn't come without a mayor flaw though in my eyes; The fact you have to play it always online to make any progress in commendation or the other 90% of what the game has to offer- Despite playing the game for over 1000h at the time of writing; I still don't play every day and play more casually with friends who may not even have more than 50h in the game yet. 

The fact it's always online means there's a high chance for you to just randomly get attacked by another crew; part of the game I know- but being chased for hours while just trying to do a Story Quest or simply trying to have fun with my partner is not a great experience for anyone involved. The fact it's other players also means that usually, the ones attacking are people who play the game often enough to just utterly destroy casual players- meaning it feels somewhat unfair to go against these kinds of people at times, where you spend hours exploring, collecting loot, just for it to be taken away by a crew of 3 who played the game religiously and know every trick in the book.

There is a ""Safer Seas"" option in the game, but it doesn't allow for most commendations, trading company flags, etc. basically locking you out of rather important content.

It doesn't ruin the full game for me personally, but I would honestly enjoy some solution where you can just play the game at your own pace without the sweats comin for your ass because you dug up a Reapers Bounty randomly or they simply saw a flag on the horizon-

Great game, though try and get a hang of PVP rather quick or you will most likely get your loot plundered often, often making you quit the game in a rather upset mood, especially with how toxic some players can get against newer crews.",0.8466084599494934,positive,0.8466084599494934,0,2025-09-03 13:26:48+00,2025-09-18 15:44:18.581585+00

1172620,Sea of Thieves,"Sea of Thieves is an amazing game both for Solos or if you want to play w friends. However I will say that the game is most enjoyable with friends since honestly speaking thats the main design of the game. That youre pirate w your own pirate crew. Pillaging and exploring the sea of thieves its an amazing experience. Although I did say that you can enjoy the game as a solo it wasnt a lie. I currently have almost 130 hours on the game all solo, maybe 2 hours w a random person i met within the game but mainly solo. The one thing I will point out tho is that if youre hoping to sail the seas w a big galleon type ship you see within the game or in movies, yeah no its not gonna happen as a solo. As a solo youre really only able to get on the sloop to not get obliterated by other pirates that actually have a crew. You can still choose to sail with a galleon ship as a solo just not recommended. Honestly speaking its an enjoyable experience overall but again pointing out youll get the maximum experince of the game playing w youre friends vs playing alone. All in all a solid game i give it an 8/10 totally recommend.

The amount of times I got messed with by a modder is insane and the fact this game can't handle these modder is even more annoying. My friends told me to get the enhanced gta too but guess what that game is going to slowly get modders as well. Honestly game might be fun for a bit but not for the long run.

440,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2 is a masterpiece that Valve has largely abandoned, yet it refuses to die. Despite experiencing no significant updates, facing a bot crisis, and suffering from balancing issues, you can still hop in and find a surprisingly nice community. Most players are just there to have fun, which is a refreshing contrast to the profound immaturity often displayed in the game. Picture this: 30-year-olds playing alongside 12-year-olds, all sharing an edgy sense of humor that can make the experience feel like a true melting pot of chaos!

When you load into a new match, whether casual or community, you meet at least 20 new players. While some are genuinely nice, many are more interested in making connections than actually playing the game. You might even receive a marriage proposal in the chat, often from someone with a name as insufferable as the proposal itself.

The game features nine unique and iconic classes, each offering something for everyone. It‚Äôs like a buffet of mayhem! The art style is reminiscent of a comic book, standing the test of time and never looking bad. The Meet the Team videos provide insight into each class's specialties and showcase the game‚Äôs goofy tone, while the SFM videos represent a beautiful art form that I hope never disappears. 

I've been playing since 2008 on PS3, and words cannot fathom my love for this game. It has a deep place in my heart, and the late nights I played with friends growing up, hold fond memories. It‚Äôs a laid-back game where you can chat and play in the background, sometimes a guilty pleasure, other times a time killer, but always somehow a good time. Despite its flaws, Team Fortress 2 remains a favorite, likely always will be, and may it live forever, continuing to evoke a sense of nostalgia and connection.",0.6954106688499451,positive,0.6954106688499451,0,2025-09-06 07:46:18+00,2025-09-18 15:46:56.24507+00

JewelPrincess seems to be the one that's in most NA east servers or however that works. I've reported and tried to kick to no avail. Most of the time I spend playing this game is watching the intro graphics, on a black screen loading into an ""interior"" or the inside of a building, or in the clouds. I assume all of these stem from the terrorists but I have no way of knowing because I cant even see them. This is all after a year or so hiatus just playing other games. Although the modders were there to greet me, they were bad before but I think they're worse now, I forgot to mention that there are people that periodically join lobbies and advertise selling money and account leveling which should interest rockstar considering I see the ads for shark cards every time I try to play. They could easily just ban most of the accounts if they got on the game for a few hours here and there. Not hard to miss.

GTA 5 is one of the best open-world games I've ever played. From the moment you start, you're pulled into an incredibly detailed and immersive world that feels alive. The storyline is exciting and packed with action, humor, and unforgettable characters like Trevor, Michael, and Franklin.

The freedom the game gives you is amazing‚Äîyou can follow missions, explore the city, drive around, fly planes, go diving, or just cause chaos for fun. The graphics still hold up really well, even years after release. Plus, the soundtrack is top-notch and fits the vibe of the game perfectly.

GTA Online adds even more value, letting you play with friends, do heists, build businesses, and more. Rockstar really put a lot of love into this game, and it shows.

Otherwise you'll get caught grinding hours on end solo, and get bored quick and have to improve drastically with the PVP mechanics. If you are a fan of FPS and looking to play solo, theirs A LOT of PVP mechanics, from harpoon, cannons, boarding, water boarding, cannon boarding, sword dashing- and the list goes on, than you may find this game enjoyable. Me personally, I get burnt out playing solo, as its not as much fun being able to joke around with friends and overall be more careless on loot in return to have fun instead.

1172620,Sea of Thieves,"As this game gets older less people play, it's mostly experienced people who play all the time remaining on the high seas.  I have 20 hours on PC, and every single time I do any events or quests I have been utterly destroyed by looters who don't even do quests anymore.  I just did a whole stronghold, and some experienced players lurked around the corner for me to get done before swooping in and taking everything.  I even knew they were there but had already committed to the stronghold.  So weird to me how they love the game so much to be well versed in combat and using items, but they also go out of their way to stunt the growth of their community.  

I know when to admit I'm just bad at a game- and I'm not one to complain much about pvp and toxicity, but what IS dumb is the fact the game punishes you for wanting to play on the safer seas.  30% gold rate and stunded rep growth is insane for safer seas, and you're not even allowed to use the same ship you've customized in high seas.  It's better than the 0% I've been getting in high seas, but damn is it much less rewarding/satisfying.  When playing on the xbox years ago I at least encountered friendlies.  Could get through a few quests too before being destroyed by people better than me haha....  Maybe if they change it to 60-70% rewards on safer seas, make more events and loot available, and also let players use their customized ship I'll change my mind.  Not very friendly to new playerz (who this review is aimed towards).  Either get all of your stuff stolen or play on stupid baby mode with hardly any rewards. 

Just be wary if you're curious about getting the game.  You can definitely learn how to play decently and have some fun on the safe seas, but look into the limits that it imposes versus the things you're able to earn on the high seas.  The gameplay loop is definitely enjoyable and there's lots to do for a bit, but you won't be meeting any John Anticheats that's for sure.",-0.6664400100708008,negative,0.6664400100708008,0,2025-09-22 02:41:17+00,2025-09-22 12:38:38.441306+00
